# Basic Echidna configuration for fuzzlib E2E testing
# This configuration provides balanced testing parameters for validating
# fuzzlib functionality under Echidna fuzzing campaigns.

# Test execution parameters
seqLen: 50                     # Moderate sequence length - generates 50 transactions per test sequence
testLimit: 5000               # Quick but thorough testing - run 5000 test sequences
shrinkLimit: 1000             # Basic shrinking - attempt to minimize failing sequences up to 1000 times

# Testing modes
testMode: assertion           # Enable assertion testing - check Solidity assert() statements
coverage: true                # Enable coverage tracking - monitor code coverage during fuzzing

# Deployment configuration
deployer: "0x10000"           # Simple test address for contract deployment
sender: ["0x20000"]           # Single sender address for transaction generation

# Compilation configuration
cryticArgs: ["--foundry-compile-all"]  # Compile all contracts with Foundry
disableSlither: true                   # Disable Slither static analysis

# Output configuration
format: text                  # Use text format for readable output
quiet: false                  # Show detailed output during execution

# Gas configuration - use reasonable limits for testing
balanceAddr: 0xffffffffffffffff    # Large balance for test accounts

# Timeout configuration
timeout: 300                  # 5 minute timeout for the entire campaign
